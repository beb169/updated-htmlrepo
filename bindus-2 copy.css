/* My issue with uploading this to git is twofold: first, using the repo website
 * that I generated last class, it's only presenting my readme.md file. Second, 
 * when I try to `git push` in my command line, it keeps asking for my github user
 * and password authentication. I enter my user and password for github.com, but it
 * keeps telling me that I have a "fatal" error, and it won't push my new docs to 
 * github automatically. I was able to get my docs into my folder on my computer, but 
 * I can't get any farther than this.*/
